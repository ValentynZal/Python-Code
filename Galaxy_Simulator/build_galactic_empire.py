"""
1 Pick a location in the galaxy, an average travel speed of 5 to 10 percent of the speed of light,
    and a time step of 500,000 years.
2 At each time step, calculate the size of the expanding colonization bubble
    and update the galaxy map.
3 Check your results by placing the homeÂ­world location at the center of the galaxy,
    setting the speed to 1 , and confirming that it takes 50,000 years to reach the edge of the galaxy.

* Test how fast we would need to go to explore the galaxy in 10 million years
* Estimate how much of the galaxy the STF could have explored in its first 100 years,
    assuming they averaged 100x light speed
